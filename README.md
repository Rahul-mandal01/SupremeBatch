# SupremeBatch - DSA and Problem-Solving Repository

Welcome to the **SupremeBatch** repository! ðŸŽ‰  

This repository contains all my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice codes and problem-solving solutions. It serves as a collection of my learning journey, where I solve problems from various platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**, and others.  

## Purpose
- To document and organize my DSA learning journey.
- To practice and improve my problem-solving skills.
- To solve and share solutions to problems from popular coding platforms.

## Features
- Solutions to problems from platforms like:
  - **LeetCode**
  - **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**]
- Covers a wide range of topics in DSA, including but not limited to:
  - Arrays, Strings, and Linked Lists.
  - Stacks, Queues, and Hashmaps.
  - Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming.
  - Sorting, Searching, and Greedy Algorithms.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahul-mandal01/SupremeBatch.git

2. Navigate through the folders to find solutions to specific topics or problems.
 
3. Each file contains a solution to a problem along with the approach and logic (if included).

## Notes
- This repository is for learning and practice purposes and might not include optimized or production-ready code.
- I am actively learning and will continuously contribute to this repository with new solutions and improvements.
- Suggestions and feedback are always welcome! ðŸ˜Š

#### Thank you for visiting my repository. Stay tuned for updates as I continue my journey in DSA and problem-solving! ðŸš€
